API client side code generation

## Description

Using Swagger Code Generation for API clients offers several benefits, enhancing the efficiency and consistency of API development and integration processes. Swagger Code Generation streamlines the API development process, ensures consistency between the API and client libraries, supports multiple languages and frameworks, and offers customization options. These benefits make it a valuable tool for developers working with APIs.

### Key advantages:

- Automated Code Generation: Swagger Codegen automates the creation of client libraries, server stubs, and API documentation from an OpenAPI Specification. This significantly reduces manual coding efforts and accelerates the development process.
- Support for Multiple Languages and Frameworks: It supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, including Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, C#, Go, PHP, and Swift. This versatility ensures that developers can generate code for their preferred technology stack.
- Consistency Across API and Client Libraries: By generating code from the API specification, Swagger Codegen ensures that the client libraries are always in sync with the API. This consistency reduces integration errors and simplifies API updates.
- Customization Through Templates and Plugins: Developers can customize the generated code to meet their specific project requirements using templates and plugins. This flexibility allows for the adjustment of code appearance and behavior.
- Community Support and Regular Updates: Being an open-source project, Swagger Codegen benefits from active community support on platforms like GitHub. Regular updates introduce new features and address bugs, ensuring the tool remains effective and up-to-date.
- Streamlined API Testing and Integration: The tool simplifies API testing by generating client SDKs that can be used for integration testing. This helps in identifying and fixing issues early in the development cycle.
- Facilitates Collaboration: Swagger Codegen can improve collaboration between frontend and backend teams by providing clear API contracts and automatically generated SDKs. This ensures both teams work with consistent and up-to-date API interfaces.
- Reduces Technical Debt: By automating the generation of boilerplate code, Swagger Codegen helps in reducing technical debt. Developers can focus on implementing business logic rather than writing repetitive code.
